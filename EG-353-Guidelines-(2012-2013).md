EG-353 Module Information is available on the Blackboard module site. Students and their supervisors would be well advised to read this.

## General

All projects are driven from the Blackboard module site [EG-353 Research Project (2012-2013)](https://blackboard.swan.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/execute/modulepage/view?course_id=_25648_1&cmp_tab_id=_18144_1&editMode=true&mode=cpview#). Announcements, deadlines, information about briefings plus a lot more will all made available here. It is therefore vital that all project students and their supervisors refer to this site regularly for up-to-date information. Supervisors should stress to their students how important this is. Please note that *supervisors* are responsible for advising their students on a day-to-day basis about their projects as well as for recording grades and providing feedback on certain assessments<a href="#feedback" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>. 


As Blackboard has much more flexibility in setting up mailing lists, only very rarely will the Intranet be used to send email. It’s also worth noting that Blackboard will automatically forward copies of announcements, calendar events, task reminders, etc  by email. That said, communication preferences can be overridden by users on a case-by-case basis.
Our advice is to leave at least announcement notifications turned on. It’s worth noting that all communications from Blackboard are sent to the Student’s University Email account. Unlike the Intranet, there is no facility for sending a copy of an email to a student’s personal account. Thus students must ensure that they read their University email regularly and ensure that their mailbox is not full. For ease of identification, all email from Blackboard will include the module site prefix **[1213_EG-353]** in the subject line.

Here is a brief synopsis of some of the requirements between now and the end of the first term. This will all be explained on Blackboard. Please note that staff have instructor access and can see all the materials that are available on Blackboard if they switch to “edit mode”. For the research project site, my intentions are to keep the Blackboard site (EG-353) as simple and as close as possible to the standard Blackboard module site layout. This is to ensure that students (and staff) are more likely to find the essential information that they require. Students sending e-mails asking questions which are already answered on Blackboard will be directed back to the Blackboard site for their information. Supervisors should ask their students to confirm that they can access Blackboard and the EG-353 module site as soon as possible<a href="#bb-enrolment" id="fn2">2<sup></a>. 

 
## Semester 1 Activities

### Briefings for Engineering students


There will be 4 briefings for EG-353 this term, each delivered twice per week. Each Thursday (4th, 11th, 18th, 25th October) in the Faraday Lecture Theatre (5pm) repeated on Friday (5th, 12th, 19th and 26th October) in the Faraday Lecture Theatre (3pm). The session you are expected to attend will be indicated in your Level 3 timetable. If you miss a session, it will be videoed and a recording will be made available on Blackboard. Any presentations or notes will be made available in the appropriate **Briefing Notes** folder in the **Module Content** part of the Blackboard site.

The following briefings will be given:

* Introduction to the Project 
* Project Risk Assessment and Planning
* Research Techniques and Tools
* Employability, SEA and PDP

*Note that briefings are compulsory*. The first one introduces students to the project and the supporting Blackboard site and will be co-presented by Professor Steve Brown, Deputy Head of College and Head of Teaching. This will be followed over the following three weeks by other important briefings on project planning, risk assessment and safety, research techniques and tools and careers.
 
The dates and times for the briefings and the notes for the briefings are given on the Blackboard site. Many of the queries from students about these matters can be directed to this site.

### Assessed items ####

#### Health & Safety Risk Assessment (RA)

The supervisor must complete an online RA after meeting with the student. This will normally be completed by week 4. Full information on H&S is given on Blackboard.

#### Project Plan

The project title, a brief description, list of deliverables and milestones and a project plan must be completed by every student and submitted by 4.30 pm on Friday 26th of October 2012. A template for this purpose will be delivered via Blackboard. Assessment and feedback on the progress report will be handled by the supervisor using the Blackboard Grade Centre.


#### Progress Report

A progress report is to be submitted by each student at the end of the first semester. This will evaluate progress against plan and note any changes required. A template will be provided and the Deadline is 14th December 2012. Assessment and feedback on the progress report will be handled by the supervisor using the Blackboard Grade Centre.

## Semester 2 Activities



### Briefings for Engineering Students

There will be a briefing in Week 1 of the end of Semester 2 on Writing the Draft Paper. This will be followed by weekly briefings by Sandy George on “English for Academic Purposes” which are primarily intended to support our International students but to which all students are welcome to attend. There will be a final briefing on Presentations after the Easter break. Timings and details of these Semester 2 Briefings will be announced on Blackboard.



### Assessed Items

#### Research Paper

In order to provide sufficient time for feedback, a *draft* of the student's research paper must be submitted through TurnitIn by **8th March 2013**. The draft will be reviewed by the second marker and feedback on the draft will be provided. This will be done in a similar way to a technical paper review: the draft will not be not marked but advice on improving the paper for final submission will be invaluable to the student. The review and feedback process will be handled through TunrnitIn GradeMark.

The final paper (including electronic “camera copy”) together with a copy of the Student’s CV and a reflection on the employability benefits of the project must be submitted by Wednesday 24th April 2013. 

#### Presentation and Defence

* Each student will make a 10 minute presentation of his or her work.
* The examiners will ask the student to defend his or her work by means of a 15 minute a *viva voce* examination. 
* At this time, the logbook will be also inspected by the examiners and formally assessed. 

The presentation and defence session will last 30 minutes per student and will take place during *Project Assessment Week*, starting Monday 6th May, 2013. (TBC) The examination
timetable for each research centre will be issued by the Research Centre Coordinator at the start of the summer term.

## Employabilty ##

Employability. Students will be encouraged to take advantage of the [Swansea Employability Award (SEA)](http://sea.swansea.ac.uk) but even if they do not, they must prepare a CV and a short 500 word document reflecting on how the project has benefitted their employability. The mechanics for submitting the CV and the reflection are still being formulated, but it is possible that PebblePad ePortfolio tool will be used. More details will be announced in due course.

## Communications

The Blackboard Research project site should be referred to constantly for updates and announcements. E-mails from Dr Chris Jobling  (EG-353 coordinator), and the research centre project coordinators Prof Michael Edwards (C2EC), Dr David Isaacs (MRC) and Dr Paul Williams (MNC) are relevant to all students and should be noted and recorded for future reference.


## Footnotes

<a id="feedback" href="#fn1">1</a> This will be done and managed through the Grade Centre on the Blackboard module site.

<a id="bb-enrolment" href="#fn2">2</a> It's worth noting that as an instructor on the module site, you are able to enrol your own students If they can't access the site using the User enrolment tools.
