EG-353 Module Information is available on the Blackboard module site. Students and their supervisors would be well advised to read this.

## General

All projects are driven from the Blackboard module site [EG-353 Research Project (2013-2014)](https://blackboard.swan.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/execute/modulepage/view?course_id=_27996_1&cmp_tab_id=_23066_1&editMode=true&mode=cpview). Announcements, module calendar, deadlines, information about briefings plus a lot more will all made available here. It is therefore vital that all project students and their supervisors refer to this site regularly for up-to-date information. Supervisors should stress to their students how important this is. Please note that *supervisors* are responsible for advising their students on a day-to-day basis about their projects as well as for recording grades and providing feedback on certain assessments<a href="#feedback" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>. 


As Blackboard has much more flexibility in setting up mailing lists, only very rarely will the Intranet be used to send email. It’s also worth noting that Blackboard will automatically forward copies of announcements, calendar events, task reminders, etc  by email. That said, communication preferences can be overridden by users on a case-by-case basis.
Our advice is to leave at least announcement notifications turned on. It’s worth noting that all communications from Blackboard are sent to the Student’s University Email account. Unlike the Intranet, there is no facility for sending a copy of an email to a student’s personal account. Thus students must ensure that they read their University email regularly and ensure that their mailbox is not full. For ease of identification, all email from Blackboard will include the module site prefix **[1314_EG-353]** in the subject line.

Here is a brief synopsis of some of the requirements between now and the end of the first term. This will all be explained on Blackboard. Please note that staff have instructor access and can see all the materials that are available on Blackboard if they switch to “edit mode”. For the research project site, my intentions are to keep the Blackboard site (EG-353) as simple and as close as possible to the standard Blackboard module site layout. This is to ensure that students (and staff) are more likely to find the essential information that they require. Students sending e-mails asking questions which are already answered on Blackboard will be directed back to the Blackboard site for their information. Supervisors should ask their students to confirm that they can access Blackboard and the EG-353 module site as soon as possible<sup><a href="#bb-enrolment" id="fn2">2</a></sup>. 

 
## Semester 1 Activities

### Briefings for Engineering students


There will be weekly briefings for EG-353 this term, each delivered twice per week. Each Thursday in the Faraday Lecture Theatre (3 pm) repeated on Friday in  Glyndwr D (1 pm). The session you are expected to attend will be indicated in your Level 3 timetable. If you miss a session, it will be videoed and a recording will be made available on Blackboard. Any presentations or notes will be made available in the appropriate **Briefings** folder in the **Module Content** part of the Blackboard site.

*Note that briefings are compulsory*. The first one introduces students to the project and the supporting Blackboard site and will be co-presented by Professor Steve Brown, Deputy Head of College and Head of Teaching. This will be followed over the following weeks by other important briefings as shown in the following provisional list:

* Introduction to the Project - Prof. Steve Brown
* Project Risk Assessment and Planning - Dr Jobling
* Using the Library for Research - Engineering Librarian
* Employability, SEA and PDP - Engineering Careers Advisor
* Unfair Practice - University Superintendent of Examinations
* Research Tools and Techniques - Dr Jobling
* Atkins Carbon Critical Award - Representative of Atkins (TBC)
* Maintaining Your Bibliography - Dr Jobling

The dates and times for the briefings and the notes for the briefings are given on the Blackboard site and will be posted in the Module Calendar which students can export into their calendar app on smart phones, tablet or laptop. Many of the queries from students about these matters can be directed to this Blackboard.

### Assessed items ####

#### Health & Safety Risk Assessment (RA)

The supervisor must complete an online RA after meeting with the student. This will normally be completed by week 4. Full information on H&S is given on Blackboard and will be covered in the second briefing. Students are not be allowed to use laboratories before the risk assessment is complete. To emphasise this, they will not be able to submit their CV until it is done.

#### Project Plan

The project title, a brief description, list of deliverables and milestones and a project plan must be completed by every student and submitted by 4.30 pm on Friday 25th of October 2013. A template for this purpose will be delivered via Blackboard. Assessment and feedback on the progress report will be handled by the supervisor using a new intranet feedback system that is being developed for the College Intranet. Feedback to students will be via Blackboard.


#### Employabilty ##

Employability will be the topic of the fourth briefing, but it should be emphasized to all students throughout the year. Students will be encouraged to take advantage of the [Swansea Employability Award (SEA)](http://sea.swansea.ac.uk) but even if they do not, they *must* prepare a CV which will be submitted via Blackboard by 4.30 pm on Friday 8th November 2013ls -l
. Feedback on the CV will be given by supervisors in the first meeting with students after the submission deadline. The date of the deadline is chosen because there are numerous employment events, for example Postgraduate Open Days, Milk Round visits for Employers, etc. that take place all year round and students should be prepared for these early. A final reflection on how the project has prepared students for the world of employment will be submitted along with the final paper.

#### Progress Report

A progress report is to be submitted by each student at the end of the first semester. This will evaluate progress against plan and note any changes required. A template will be provided and the Deadline is 13th December 2013. *Submission of a progress report will only be allowed if students have submitted their CV*. Assessment and feedback on the progress report will be handled by the supervisor using a new intranet feedback system that is being developed for the College Intranet. Feedback to students will be via Blackboard.

## Semester 2 Activities



### Briefings for Engineering Students

There will be a briefing in Week 1 of Semester 2 on Writing the Draft Paper. This will be followed by weekly briefings by on “English for Academic Purposes” which are primarily intended to support our International students but to which all students are welcome to attend. There will be a final briefing on Presentations just before the Easter break. Timings and details of these Semester 2 Briefings will be announced on Blackboard.


### Assessed Items


#### Draft Research Paper

In order to provide sufficient time for feedback, a *draft* of the student's research paper must be submitted through TurnitIn by **21st March 2013**. The draft will be reviewed by the second marker and feedback on the draft will be provided before the end of term (11th April). This will be done in a similar way to a technical paper review: the draft will not be not marked but advice on improving the paper for final submission will be invaluable to the student. The review and feedback process will be handled through a new intranet feedback system that is being developed for the College Intranet. Feedback to students, including an originality report from TurnitIn, will be via Blackboard.

#### Employability Reflection ####
Students are required to provide a brief, 500 word reflection on how they think the project has prepared them for employment. This must be submitted before the final camera ready copy of the research paper can be submitted. Feedback will be given by supervisors.

#### "Camera Ready" Copy of Resarch Paper ####
The final paper (including electronic “camera copy”) together must be submitted by Tuesday 6th May 2014. 

#### Presentation and Defence
* Each student will make a 10 minute presentation of his or her work.
* The examiners will ask the student to defend his or her work by means of a 15 minute a *viva voce* examination. 
* At this time, the logbook will be also inspected by the examiners and formally assessed. 

The presentation and defence session will last 30 minutes per student and will take place during *Project Assessment Week*, starting Monday 12th May, 2014. (TBC) The examination timetable for each research centre will be issued by the Research Centre Coordinator at the start of the summer term.


## Communications

The Blackboard Research project site should be referred to constantly for updates and announcements. E-mails from Dr Chris Jobling  (EG-353 coordinator), and the research centre project coordinators Prof Michael Edwards (C2EC), Dr David Isaacs (MRC) and Dr Paul Williams (SPEC) are relevant to all students and should be noted and recorded for future reference.


## Footnotes

<a id="feedback" href="#fn1">1</a> This will be done and managed through a new project assessment workflow system being developed for the College Intranet.

<a id="bb-enrolment" href="#fn2">2</a> It's worth noting that as an instructor on the module site, you are able to enrol your own students If they can't access the site using the User enrolment tools.
