EG-353 Module Information is available on the Blackboard module site.
You and your supervisor would be well advised to read this.

## Module Coordination and Management 

After allocation, the Research Project module is managed from the *My Studies*
module site [EG-353 Research Project
(2014-2015)](https://blackboard.swan.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/execute/modulepage/view?course_id=_32430_1&cmp_tab_id=_30729_1&editMode=true&mode=cpview).
Announcements, module calendar, deadlines, information about briefings
plus a lot more will all made available there. It is therefore vital
that you and your supervisor refer to this site regularly for up-to-date
information. Your supervisor will hopefully be aware of this and will
stress to you important this is. Your supervisor is responsible for
advising you on a day-to-day basis about your project as well as for
recording grades and providing feedback on certain assessments.


As Blackboard has much more flexibility in setting up mailing lists,
only very rarely will the Intranet be used to send email. It’s also
worth noting that, *My Studies* will automatically forward copies of
announcements, calendar events, task reminders, etc  by email. That
said, you can override your communication preferences on a case-by-case
basis. Our advice is to leave at least announcement notifications turned
on. It’s worth noting that all communications from *My Studies* are sent
to your University Email account. Unlike the Intranet, there is no
facility for sending a copy of an email to a your personal account. Thus
you must ensure that you read your University email regularly and ensure
that your mailbox is not full. For ease of identification, all email
from *My Studies* will include the module site prefix **[1415_EG-353]** in
the subject line.

The rest of this document is a summary of the module description, its
learning outcomes, roles and responsibilities and some of the
requirements between now and the end of the end of your project. More
detail will be given in the timetabled briefings and be made available
on *My Studies*. Please note that your supervisor has tutor access and can
see all the materials that you can see. For the research project site,
our intentions are to keep the Blackboard site (EG-353) as simple and as
close as possible to the standard Blackboard module site layout. This is
to ensure that you and your supervisir ill be able to find the
essential information that you require. If you send an e-mail asking
questions which are already answered on *My Studies* will be directed back
to the *My Studies* site for their information. Supervisors should ask
their students to confirm that they can access *My Studies* and the EG-353
module site as soon as possible.


## Module Description

Extract of the [official module
description](https://intranet.swan.ac.uk/catalogue/default.asp?type=moddetail&dept=any&mod=EG-353&ayr=14/15&psl=TB1%2B2&detailOnly=false) [1].

> "The EG-353 Research Project module involves the application of
> scientific and engineering
> principles to the solution of a practical problem associated with
> engineering systems and processes. You will gain
> experience in working independently on a substantial, individually
> assigned task, using accepted planning procedures. It will require and
> develop self-organisation and the critical evaluation of options and
> results, as well as developing technical knowledge in the chosen topic."

The project learning outcomes are mapped to several key learning
outcomes required to satisfy the educational requirements
for Engineering Council Registration at Incorporated Engineer Level as
part of an Accredited BEng Honours Degree Standard (UK HEQF Level 6) as
defined by the UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence (UK-SPEC) [2][3]

In particular completing the project is intended to demonstrate
understanding, knowledge, know-how, skills, awareness and the ability to
handle complexity across a broad selection of the defined key learning
outcomes which are categorised under the headings of science and
mathematics, engineering analysis, design, economic, legal, social,
ethical and environmental context, engineering practice, and additional
general skills [4]. Just which subset of skills and learning outcomes
will be covered in any particular project will vary, but you should seek
to address as many as are appropriate.

We have chosen to address the learning outcomes by identifying three
types of competencies that you will demonstrate and be assessed on.
These are reproduced from the module description [1] below.

### Learning Outcomes

After completing this module you should be able to operate in each of
these three modes:

*Engineer as Practitioner*

- define a project specifying the aims, objectives and realistic
targets;
- construct a project schedule and work to that schedule;
- synthesise the various activities associated with the project;
- evaluate available options, including budgetary, sustainability 
and ethical considerations where relevant, and choose 
appropriate solutions;
- propose the development of a technical subject in some depth, largely
on your own initiative and carry this out, 
- prepare a journal article summarising your work and submitting it for
review.

*Engineer as Scientist*

- write a technical report in the form of a short (10 page) journal
article.
- compose an oral presentation (plus PowerPoint) on the progress of your
project and the results obtained and defend it against critical
appraisal;

*Engineer as Professional*

- create a project plan, perform risk assessment and report on progress;
- keep a log-book to record developments and progress;
- prepare for employment by writing a full personal CV and reflecting on
the benefits of the project in enhancing your employability.
- knowledge and understanding of issues of academic integrity and
research ethics

### Transferable Skills

- Application of number
- Problem solving
- Information retrieval and evaluation
- Critical thinking
- Digital literacy
- Written and oral communication skills
- Working with others
- Self-directed learning
- Time management

### Syllabus


- The nature of the research project varies from one student to another.
Your allotted project may involve a survey of literature, theoretical or
experimental studies, design studies, and computational studies. The academic staff of
the College of Engineering will produce a list of project descriptors
and you will be given a chance to select a project - usually over
the summer before the start of the academic year.

- You will be provided with an individual project and a
supervisor. It is recommended that you meet your supervisor at
least once a fortnight to discuss progress. You must keep a
logbook and this should be signed by your supervisor at these meetings.
It is your responsibility to ensure that the logbook is
signed.

- Briefings on risk assessment, project management, research techniques,
record keeping, report preparation and presentation skills will be
given. Precise assessment criteria, deadlines, submission formats and
instructions will be disseminated via the *My Studies* web site.

- A risk assessment for the project will be carried out in consultation
with your supervisor and signed-off by you. 

- You will prepare a project plan with stated aims, objectives and
  targets. The project plan must be submitted by the endgq of October. A
progress report (2 pages) summarising your progress against the plan is
submitted at the end of the first term. 

- Briefings on academic integrity and research ethics will be given so
that you, as a young professional, are made aware of and can discuss
those issues which will form the basis of professional codes of practice
as you embark on your future career.

- A series of employability workshops will be run by the University
Careers service in order to prepare you for life after graduation.
A full personal CV must be completed and a report on how the
dissertation has enhanced your employability will be prepared
and assessed.

- A final report in the form of a Journal article (10 pages max) will be
submitted for review before the end of the spring term and a final,
"camera ready copy", taking account of the reviewer's comments, must be
submitted after the spring vacation.

- You will attend an individual 30 minute *viva voce* examination
at the end of the project period with your supervisor and one other
member of academic staff. A suitable presentation (10 minutes) should be
prepared. At this time, your logbook will be inspected by the examiners.

## Semester 1 Activities

### Briefings for Engineering students


There will be weekly briefings for EG-353 this term, each delivered
twice per week on Mondays. These are held in Glyndwr D (10 am) repeated
in Faraday A at 2 pm The session you are expected to attend will be
indicated in your Level 3 timetable. If you miss a session, it will be
videoed and a recording will be made available on *My Studies*. Any
presentations or notes will be made available in the appropriate
**Briefings** folder in the **Module Content** part of the *My Studies*
site.

*Note that briefings are compulsory*. The first one introduces you
to the project and the supporting *My Studies* site. Your supervisor is
also welcome to attend! This will be followed over the following weeks by
briefings on the following topics:

- Health and Saftey and Project Planning - Dr Jobling
- Using the Library for Research - Engineering Librarian
- Academic Integrity - University Superintendent of Examinations
- Research Tools and Techniques - Dr Jobling
- Atkins Carbon Critical Award - Representative of Atkins (TBC)
- Maintaining Your Bibliography - Dr Jobling
- Research Ethics - Prof. McNamee
- Employability, SEA and PDP - Engineering Careers Advisors

The dates and times for the briefings and the notes for the briefings
will be posted on the *My Studies* site when they are confirmed and will
be posted in the Module Calendar which you can export into your calendar
app on smart phones, tablet or laptop. Many of the answers to your
queries about your project matters will also be found on *My Studies*.

### Project Deliverables

#### Health & Safety Risk Assessment (RA)

Your supervisor must complete an online RA in consultation with you. This
will normally be completed by the end of **week 4**. Full information on Health and
Safety (H&S) is given
on *My Studies* and will be covered in the second briefing.  You are not
be allowed to use laboratories before the risk assessment is complete.
To emphasise this, you will not be able to submit your CV until it is
done.  

#### Project Plan

You must complete a document consisting of an agreed project title, a
brief description, targets, list of deliverables and milestones and a project
timetable and submit this by **4.30 pm on Friday 24th of October 2015**. A
template for this purpose will be delivered via *My Studies*. Assessment
and feedback on the progress report will be handled by your supervisor
using the new intranet feedback system that was developed for the College
Intranet last year. Feedback to you will be via *My Grades* on *My
Studies*.

#### Research Methods

The research information systems provided by Information Systems and
Services (ISS) will be introduced to
you in week 3. Dr Jobling will follow up these sessions by covering
research tools and building a bibliography.

#### Academic Integrity and Research Ethics ####

These topics will be covered by the University's Superintent of
Examinations and Professor McNamee respectively.

#### Employabilty ##

Employability will be covered in a series of briefings given by the
Engineering Careers Team. These will start in November. The scheduling of the
employability briefings have been chosen because there are numerous
employment events, for example postgraduate open days, milk round visits
for employers, etc. that take place all year round and you should
be prepared for these early. 

You will be
encouraged to take advantage of the [Swansea Employability Award
(SEA)](http://sea.swansea.ac.uk) but even if you do not, you *must*
prepare a CV which will be submitted via *My Studies* in November (date to
be confirmed).  Feedback on the CV will be given by your supervisor in your first meeting
after the submission deadline. 

A final reflection on how the project has
prepared you for the world of employment will be submitted before
**24th April 2015**.

#### Progress Report

You are to submit a progress report at the end of the first semester.
This will evaluate progress against plan and note any changes required.
A template will be provided and the deadline is **12th December 2014**.
Note that *you can only submit your progress report if you have already
submitted their CV*. Assessment and feedback on the progress report will
be handled your supervisor and you will receive feedback via *My Grades*
on *My Studies*.

## Semester 2 Activities



### Briefings for Engineering Students

There will be a briefing in Week 1 of Semester 2 on writing the research
paper. This will be followed by weekly briefings from members of *Academic Success Programme* team.
These are primarily intended to support your international peers but you all are welcome to attend.
There will be a final briefing on presentations just before the ednd of
teaching in May. Timings and details of these Semester 2 Briefings will
be announced on *My Studies*.


### Project Deliverables


#### Draft Research Paper

In order to provide sufficient time for feedback, a *draft* of your 
research paper must be submitted through *My Studies* by **27th
March 2015**. The draft will be reviewed by the second marker and
feedback on the draft will be provided before the start of the summer
term (20th April). This will be done in a similar way to a technical
paper review: the draft will not be not marked but advice on improving
the paper for final submission will be invaluable to you. 
Your feedback, including an originality report from TurnitIn,
will be provided via *My Studies*.

#### Employability Reflection ####

You are required to provide a brief, 500 word reflection on how
you think the project has prepared you for employment. This must be
submitted on or before **24th April 2014** final camera ready copy of the research paper can
be submitted. Feedback will be given by your supervisor.

#### "Camera Ready" Copy of Resarch Paper ####

The final paper (including electronic “camera copy”) together must be
submitted by **Friday 8th May 2015**. 

#### Presentation and Defence

* You will make a 10 minute presentation of your work.
* The examiners will ask your to defend your work by means of a 15 minute *viva voce* examination. 
* At this time, your logbook will be also inspected by the examiners and formally assessed. 

Your presentation and defence session will last 30 minutes and 
and will take place during *Project Assessment Week*, starting **Monday
18th May, 2015**. (TBC) The examination timetable for each research centre
will be issued by the Research Centre Coordinator at the start of the
summer term.
